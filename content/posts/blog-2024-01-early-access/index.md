## Why Early Access?
We believe Early Access is the ideal approach for our game, especially given its niche—blending a Visual Novel with interactive elements. Involving players early on allows us to better tailor the experience and refine its unique features. Your feedback and suggestions will play a crucial role in shaping the game as we continue to refine and expand it.

### Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
As long as we need. We will end the Early Access when we think the current version (and its features) is fun enough for people to play.

### How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?
The full version of Sentou Gakuen is planned to bring a richer and more complete experience compared to the Early Access version. Our goal is to enhance the overall enjoyment and depth of the game through various additions and improvements, such as, but not limited to:

- Expanded Storyline
- New Characters and Locations
- Enhanced Gameplay Mechanics
- Post-Release Updates

### What is the current state of the Early Access version?
The project is still very much a work in progress, with features subject to change, addition, or even removal. We kindly ask players to keep this in mind. We're actively building the game and recognize that there's still a long journey ahead, but we believe we have a solid foundation to build upon and improve.

### Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?
Post release the game will stay Free to Play with optional DLCs.

### How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?
During the early access period, updates will be issued in a rolling release format, where hotfixes are applied that may introduce bugs, cause progression issues, and similar problems.

We urge everyone to join our [Game Hub](https://steamcommunity.com/app/405680) and participate in our discussions. Your feedback is incredibly valuable as we shape the future of the game.
