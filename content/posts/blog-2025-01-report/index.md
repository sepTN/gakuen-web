## Greetings, students!
Welcome to the first Revival Report of 2025, my beloved troublemakers! Your Principal here; You might be wondering why this Revival Report is coming to you earlier than usual. Well, we have some important news about our chaotic school that you need to hear.

### Early Access
I need to address something important. Remember when we mentioned launching Early Access in late January? Well, plans have shifted. I come to you as a bearer of bad news: our previously mentioned early access date has been postponed.

Unfortunately, our city has been experiencing severe weather conditions that have led to significant flooding in many areas. This unexpected boss battle against Mother Nature, combined with an ongoing influenza outbreak affecting our team members, has created unexpected challenges in our development. These setbacks have not only disrupted our original schedule but also turned our streets into impromptu swimming pools (not the fun kind).

After consulting with Steamworks Support and considering the backend work that also needs to be done on their side (which might take weeks), we have a new, concrete date to share with you. Sentou Gakuen: Revival will be launching on **March 3rd** or 4th (depending on your timezone) of 2025. And here's some exciting news - this new date coincides with the upcoming Steam **Visual Novel Fest**, where our game will also be participating!

You can check when Early Access launches in your local timezone by clicking [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Sentou+Gakuen%3A+Revival+Early+Access&iso=20250304T01&p1=631&ah=23&am=55)

### Looking Ahead
In next month's February Revival Report, we'll provide a detailed breakdown of what features and content you can expect during the early access period, as well as what elements will be coming in future updates. This will help you better understand the scope of our initial release and our development roadmap.

Your continued support and patience mean the world to us, and we're working hard to ensure that when you finally step through our school gates, the experience will be worth the wait.

Until then, keep those wishlists coming, stay tuned for more updates, and get ready for an exciting start to your academic career this March!

Stay chaotic (but safe)!
