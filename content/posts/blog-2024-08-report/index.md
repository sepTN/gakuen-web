## Greetings, students!
Greetings students and future troublemakers of Sentou Gakuen. It’s your Principal here with some news that has been long-overdue at this point. For so many years, our school was in a state of dereliction, forgotten like an old chalkboard covered in dust. But in this past one and half year, the development has been repicked up again from zero to revive this project. With that there are several things that I'd like to address.

## The Scrapping of Old
Originally, this project was being built in Unity, but over time, the project became bogged down with so many grievances that it was hard to move forward. So, I made the decision to scrap the old build entirely. I explored several other engines—GameMaker, Defold, and more—but in the end, I chose to stick with Godot and restarted the project from the ground up. Godot’s ease of iteration has allowed me to quickly prototype and refine the chaos that is our school. And since it's open source, I can dive right into its inner workings and make the tweaks that fit our needs perfectly.

## Technical Demo Release
Mark your calendars for September 2 or 3, 2024
(depending on where you live). This will be the first chance for you to step into the revived
Sentou Gakuen and experience the new build.

This technical demo offers you a glimpse into the world of Sentou Gakuen, featuring the opening story scene and short bit of gameplay. Please note that this demo is a technical preview and may contain game-breaking bugs, progression loss, broken menus, not yet implemented and missing features. It is pretty much a tech-demo in progress and does not represent the final version of the game.

## What about Early Access?
We are aiming to release Early Access by the end of this year. However, if we encounter delays, it may be pushed to January next year, with the exact date to be announced in the future. We're working at a pace with the intention of releasing it this year. Please note that Sentou Gakuen: Revival is still a work in progress, so we kindly ask players to keep this in mind.

Thank you for your patience, and to those who thought this school had closed its doors for good—my sincerest apologies for the long absence. All I ask is for more time to fully reboot this title and bring Sentou Gakuen back to life.

This is what I’ve got to announce for now but stay tuned for further updates in my next posts. Meanwhile you can join our Discord channel and follow our Twitter (X), the links are available up above.

-Principal,
