## Greetings, students!

Greetings, students and future troublemakers of Sentou Gakuen. It's your Principal here, back with another update as we continue to breathe new updates into our chaotic school. This past month has seen significant progress, and I'm here to share all the juicy details.

Sentou Gakuen, once lost to time like an old dusty textbook in the back of the library, is emerging stronger than ever, thanks to your support and feedback. So gather around, students! We have a lot to discuss.

### 1,000 Downloads & Our Amazing Players

First and foremost, I have exciting news to share: Sentou Gakuen has reached a milestone of **1,000 downloads**! Out of those, **150 students** have decided to step into our school and found themselves beaten up by oyajis, involved in public disorder, or caught up in other kerfuffles. Your presence and engagement mean the world to us. Whether you stayed for a moment or became part of our student body, thank you! It's a huge milestone, and it gives us the motivation to keep moving forward.

### Thank You for Your Feedback and Bug Reports

I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you who have provided feedback, reported bugs, or shared your thoughts about the game. This is a passion project, and your help goes a long way in shaping Sentou Gakuen into the experience it was always meant to be. 

Every time you point out a bug or share a suggestion, you're helping us refine the game, and we can't thank you enough for being part of the development process. From banana slip event triggers to bizarre detention mishaps, you've seen it all, and you've helped us make things better.

### Join the Discord - The Student Lounge Awaits!

Our student community is growing, and we want *you* to be a part of it. If you haven't yet, [join our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/GUJkUWymmT)! It's the perfect place to chat about your adventures, report bugs, or just hang out with other troublemakers. You'll get to interact directly with the Principal, share your stories, and stay up to date with all the latest happenings.

This is your chance to be part of the Sentou Gakuen legacy as it unfolds. Come and meet your fellow students—let's build this school together, one chaos-fueled day at a time.

### Sentou Gakuen at Steam Next Fest - October Edition!

Now, for some *really* big news: Sentou Gakuen will be joining *Steam Next Fest* this October! This is a huge opportunity for us, and we're thrilled to be able to showcase our work to a broader audience. We'll be putting out a last big update for the demo for the event, and we invite everyone to hop in, play around, and help us rack up some playtime.

Whether you're a returning student or it's your first day, we would love for you to explore the demo. Your feedback will help shape the final version of Sentou Gakuen, and every review, every bug report, every minute of playtime counts.

### How You Can Support Sentou Gakuen

Want to help us make Sentou Gakuen the best it can be? Here's how you can contribute:

- **Add Sentou Gakuen to your Steam Wishlist!** Wishlisting is one of the best ways you can support us right now. It helps boost our visibility and lets more students find our game.

## Closing in ...

As we look towards the future, the development of Sentou Gakuen is progressing steadily. Our goal remains to bring you an Early Access next, but as always, game development can be unpredictable. If necessary, we may push the release to January, but rest assured, we are committed to bring you not just a game but an experience.

Your patience means everything to us, and for those who thought this school had permanently shut its doors—my sincerest apologies for the long absence. We are here now, and we are working tirelessly to make Sentou Gakuen something truly special.

That’s all for this month's Revival Report, but there are plenty more updates to come. Stay tuned for more news, events, and fun chaos in the upcoming months! And don't forget—Steam Next Fest is just around the corner. We can't wait to see you there.

Until next time, students. Stay out of trouble (or don't—your Principal loves a good story).
