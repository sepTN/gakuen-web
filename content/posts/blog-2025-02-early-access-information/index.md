## Greetings, students!
Greetings, students and future troublemakers! Principal Honoo Masato here with an important announcement regarding the Early Access of our school! So, sharpen your pencils and prepare your wits as we enter the next phase of our development.

### Early Access
We haven’t kept up with our social media and stuff as we focus solely on the development, please pardon our silence. Our aim is to release the Early Access of this project in tandem with Steam’s **Visual Novel Fest 2025** which has left us time-crunched and handcuffed.

Our Early Access date is planned for March 3rd, 2025 (or March 4th, depending on your timezone) the same time Visual Novel Fest 2025 started. To check what time is it on your local city, please use the link [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Sentou+Gakuen%3A+Revival+Early+Access&iso=20250304T01&p1=631&ah=23&am=55).

We aim to have early access by that date and time. However, we still have some things to sort out with Steam. If there’s a delay, we will post an announcement.

### Keep Expectations in Check
As mentioned in the Store page, this project is pretty much a work in progress where there are still many features ahead of us to tackle. The reason we’re pursuing this route is that we’d like to involve the community as we build this niche game. Keep your expectations in check when dealing with an Early Access title on Steam. We understand that some people might be put off with this “Early Access” tag, but worry not, but worry not, we won’t charge players to test our early access game. The game is absolutely free and you can always add to your Wishlist and get notified later for the V1.0 release. 

### This is not a Release Version
Just to reiterate the point above. Our plan is to have early access going for at least one year before considering leaving from Early Access. This project is not a sprint, but rather a marathon. 

- Is it fun?
- Does it have enough contents?
- Does it have release blocking bugs?

Those are 3 things that we will evaluate routinely before considering to depart from Early Access. If not, then updates will continue as usual.

As mentioned elsewhere, the update will be delivered via a rolling release cycle with patches delivered every other week. There are no Alpha or any other versions, we’re working with single EA branch with the assumption of everyone’s running on the latest version.

Due to time constraints, various features we originally planned for the Early Access launch had to be postponed and moved into the post-EA launch plan.

### Progression During Early Access
Please expect some form of progression loss during this early access period as we make changes and adjustments within the game. Some progress will carry over to the V1.0 release (such as your achievement unlocks), while some won’t. 

That being said, when the Early Access concluded we do plan to bring the final end game that is “New Game+” (進級 (shinkyū), which means “advancing to the next grade.”) which gives reason for both previous and new players to try out the game from start, which will reward existing players while ensuring new players enrolling in our school aren’t left out. I would like to remind you that this is a game and not a race, so please have fun first & foremost. The details on how New Game Plus will work will be explained later, as it is still too early to discuss.

### Planned Features
In an ideal world, we’d like to have all of these features before the early access, but alas, time simply goes by so fast. Items on this list are on logs, but not sorted in any particular order:
- *More Deep Zone Exploration*. It’s a randomly generated solo dungeon, and we’d like to have at least seven themes by release.
- *Maid System*. This will work similarly to the original Sentou Gakuen. They are hireable NPCs that will assist you in combat.
- *Player Housing*. Right now all students are renting on an apartment procured by school. Later on, they will be able to own property that provides boosts (such as energy) and a private space where other students can visit.
- *Party Based Co-Op Exploration*. A harder version of dungeon that will require multiple students to clear it.
- *More events*. School-wide events that involve all students, as well as smaller encounters that happen within a zone.

### Closing Words
That’s it for now, we thank you for your time, and please have a great day!

P.S.: There is no February 2025 report, as this suffices.
