## Greetings, students!
Welcome back, troublemakers and future students of Sentou Gakuen! It's your Principal here with the latest updates on our school's revival. As we approach the end of the year, we have some important news to share.
### Early Access Date
I know many of you have been eagerly awaiting our official early access date. We've been working tirelessly to bring you Sentou Gakuen, and I'm thrilled to announce that the date has been set to January 27th, 2025. *cough cough* This carefully chosen date will let us incorporate your feedback and ensure your return to our chaotic halls is absolutely spectacular... *ahem* Though I must mention that this particular week happens to coincide with a series of national holidays in Indonesia *cough* not that it influenced our decision-making process at all! *wheeze*

### MacOS Support
Originally we intended to support only Windows and Linux, but our plans have expanded.

We're happy to announce that MacOS support is coming to Sentou Gakuen! Our aim is to create a smooth experience for MacOS users, letting them wreak havoc in style. The game will run natively on Apple Silicon processors, with support launching either at early access launch or shortly afterward. 

Note that the older Intel-based Macs won't be supported as we're just following Apple's transition to their superior Apple Silicon architecture *ahem*. Though we must admit, those Intel Macs did make excellent space heaters during winter... but that's beside the point! Apple Silicon for... *cough* ...life! üçé

## Wrapping Up
That's all for now! Keep an eye out for our December Revival Report‚Äîwe'll be sharing more updates. Stay tuned!

Your continued support and patience mean the world to us. We're committed to delivering an unforgettable experience that will make your return to Sentou Gakuen truly special. Keep causing trouble (responsibly, of course), and get ready for an exciting start to the new year with Sentou Gakuen!

Until next time,

-Principal
