## Attention, students!
To celebrate the start of Early Access, we're kicking things off with a special event—and not just any event, but one that could save the world as we know it!

I come bearing urgent news! A meddling granny—yes, the wise, all-seeing elder who watches over the neighborhood—has raised a grave concern over the state of our neighbourhood. She says that people these days throw things around like they own the place! Trash piling up in the streets, mysterious junk appearing after fights—if we don't act now, this could be the end of civilization as we know it!

That's why, as responsible students of Sentou Gakuen, it's time for us to take action!

### Event Duration
📅 **Start**: March 3rd, 2025  
📅 **End**: April 3rd, 2025  

### Event Details
During this event, mobs will randomly drop **“Garbage”** items. Your mission? **Gather as much as possible** and turn them in at the **Garbage Collection Site**, located in the residential district near your shoddy apartment. Each piece of garbage you collect will contribute to your total score, proving that you're not just some litterbug but a model student of society!

### Rewards
This is our chance to make things right! So get out there, clean up the streets, and show that we're not a generation of slackers! The fate of our world (or at least our school) depends on it!
- Your Name in the Museum!
    All students who participate will be permanently recorded in the City Museum.
- Ranking System!
    The more you collect, the higher your rank—show off your dedication and aim for the top!

### Launch Discount – Limited Time Offer!
To celebrate the Early Access launch, we'll be offering a **15% launch discount** on two optional **DLCs**! This special offer is only available for a limited time, so be sure to grab them before the offer vanishes into the abyss of missed opportunities!

Don't say I didn't warn you—opportunities, like uncollected garbage, have a way of disappearing when you least expect it.

Now move, students!
