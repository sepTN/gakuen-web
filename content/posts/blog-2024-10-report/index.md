## Greetings, students!
Welcome back, troublemakers and aspiring chaos-makers of Sentou Gakuen! Your Principal here, ready to deliver the October 2024 Revival Report. Grab your seats and hold onto your uniforms, because we've got some exciting updates to share!

### Steam Next Fest: Thanks for Playing
First and foremost, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to each and every one of you who took the time to play our demo during Steam Next Fest. Your participation, feedback, and enthusiasm have been absolutely invaluable. You've helped put Sentou Gakuen on the map, and for that, we can't thank you enough!

### 7000+ Wishlists: You're Making Us Blush!
Speaking of putting us on the map, I'm thrilled to announce that we've surpassed 7000 wishlists on Steam! This is an incredible milestone that we couldn't have achieved without your support. Every wishlist is a vote of confidence in our chaotic little school, and we're honored by your interest. If you haven't added us to your wishlist yet, what are you waiting for? Join the troublemaking party!

### Demo Update: A Brief Hiatus
Now, I have an important announcement for all you eager beavers craving more content. Our beloved (or perhaps infamous?) demo version is taking a little vacation from updates. As we shift our focus back to the dev branch, the demo will remain unchanged for a while. But don't fret! While this news might ruffle a few feathers, rest assured that the demo is still available and will stay online for your troublemaking pleasure.

## What's Next?
I'm afraid I'll have to leave you in suspense for just a little bit longer. Keep your eyes peeled for our next Revival Report in November 2024. We'll have more updates, more chaos, and who knows? Maybe even a surprise or two up our sleeves.

As always, your continued support and patience mean the world to us. Sentou Gakuen is more than just a game—it's a community, and you're all an integral part of it. Whether you've been with us since the beginning from previous decade or you've just enrolled, know that you're helping to shape the future of our beloved school.

Until next time, keep causing trouble (responsibly, of course), and remember: in Sentou Gakuen, chaos isn't just encouraged—it's part of the curriculum!
