## Greetings, students!

Welcome to the final Revival Report of 2024, my beloved troublemakers! Your Principal here, ready to wrap up this incredible year with some important updates about our chaotic school.

### The Road to Early Access
As many of you know, we're in the final stretch of preparation for our Early Access launch in late January. our development has been slowly progressing as the clock ticks forward, fueled by an endless supply of coffee and the occasional instant noodles (Indomie). The halls of Sentou Gakuen are buzzing with activity as we polish every corner and fix every loose floorboard (well, except for the ones we're keeping intentionally loose for... educational purposes).

### Setting Expectations
Now, I need to have a serious talk with you all. *adjusts glasses* While we're incredibly excited about the Early Access launch, it's important to understand what this means. This version of Sentou Gakuen is just the beginning of our journey together. Think of it as your first day at school – there's still so much more to learn and experience ahead.

The development will continue for at least another year after the Early Access launch, with regular updates, new content, and improvements based on your feedback. Some features might be rough around the edges, and you might encounter a few... unexpected surprises (though in Sentou Gakuen, those are part of the charm, aren't they?).

### Holiday Wishes
As we close out 2024, I want to wish all our students, future troublemakers, and their families a wonderful holiday season. May your celebrations be filled with joy, your new year full of promise, and your schemes... well, let's just say I'll pretend I didn't see anything. *winks*

Take this time to rest, recharge, and maybe practice your running speed – you'll need it when you return to our halls in January!

### Closing Thoughts
This might be our last Revival Report for 2024, but it's just the beginning of our story. Keep those wishlists coming, stay tuned for more updates, and get ready for an exciting start to 2025 with our Early Access launch.

Until next year, stay chaotic (but safe)!
