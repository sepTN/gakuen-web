Do you enjoy Visual Novels? Have you ever wondered what it would be like if the other characters you encounter were actual players like yourself? Sentou Gakuen: Revival takes the Visual Novel experience to the unknown level where the traditional Visual Novel experience collides with MMORPG elements in a chaotic, player-driven, high school setting.

## About the Game
You are a student at a random high school in Japan, where delinquency, chaos, and strange occurrences are everyday events. How will you navigate this wild environment? Will you make allies or enemies? The choice is yours as you carve out your own story in this atypical school setting.

## Gameplay
The game is presented in a Visual Novel style, but unlike traditional VNs, the characters you interact with are not just NPCs—they are players with their own unique stories. Once you finish your first day, you're free to forge your own path without predefined storylines.
The world of Sentou Gakuen is dynamic, with a day/night cycle that affects everything from the availability of shops, accessible zones, to the spawning of mobs.

## Features
- Visual Novel: Enjoy story that plays just like a classic Visual Novel. The story mode provides a single-player narrative experience, giving you the feel of a traditional VN, seamlessly blended with the rest of the gameplay.
- 31 Unique Zones: Explore beyond the school’s walls with 31 distinct zones, each with its own upgrades and secrets to uncover.
- Interactive Combat System: Enjoy an active, engaging combat system that adds variety to the narrative-heavy gameplay.
- Character Customization: Personalize your character with various bases and customization options.
- Crafting & Item System: Customize and craft your own gear to suit your playstyle, with no predefined recipes.
- Dynamic World: Experience a day/night system where certain areas change, mobs spawn at different times, and events unfold according to the time of day.
- Steam Achievements & Leaderboards: Compete with others through achievements and online leaderboards.
