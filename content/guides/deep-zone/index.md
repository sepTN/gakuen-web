Deep Zone is a mysterious and ever-changing area where the **layout shifts** with every exploration.

Due to its unpredictable nature, students are required to obtain a special permit from the Student Council before they can enter the Deep Zone. This permit ensures that only authorized students can venture into the zone, given its potential dangers.

Each student that completed exploration contributes to the school's collective pool of **Discovery Level**. The more points students accumulate, the greater the rewards for everyone involved.

- Difficulty affects level scaling.
- Permit must be used before entry.
- In case of emergency, a helicopter will be dispatched to evacuate students.

Three objectives are available for students to complete in the Deep Zone:
- **Quick**: A short and straightforward mission that can be completed in short time.
- **Standard**: A moderate mission that requires more time and effort to complete.
- **Extended**: A full-scale mission that demands the most time and effort to complete.

Despite numerous explorers and students attempting to locate it, no one has ever confirmed its existence, leading many to believe it's either lost to time or a mere figment of imagination.
