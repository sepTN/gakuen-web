In Sentou Gakuen: Revival, students can join school factions to show their allegiance and support. Each faction has its own unique characteristics and background, and students can choose to join the faction that best aligns with their values and goals. Joining a faction can also provide opportunities for collaboration and competition with other students, as well as access to faction-specific buffs in certain zones.

### Yami (闇)
The Free Students of Yami believes that Sentou Gakuen should be a place where students can express their individuality and explore their personal strengths. They reject the rigid structure of Hikari, opting instead for a more fluid and flexible approach. Yami views diversity as the true source of strength and believes that freedom is essential for growth and progress.
