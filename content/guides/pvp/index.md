## Player versus Player
In Sentou Gakuen: Revival, you’re not alone in the academy—other students are always looking to test their strength! Brawling with fellow students is a common occurrence, and Player versus Player (PvP) encounters can result in two possible outcomes:
- Draw: Both participants survive the fight.
- Injury: One of the participants is knocked out.

{{< alert >}}Note: PvP is meant purely for fun and friendly competition. It’s not an efficient way to grind for EXP or progress, so enjoy it as a way to show off your skills and prove your strength!{{< /alert >}}

Currently, there are three ways to challenge other players to a fight:

### Duel
The classic way to settle differences between students. A duel requires both participants to be in the same area and agree to the fight. If one of the students refuses or leaves the area, the duel is canceled.
- Available areas: Any area where duels are permitted.

### Sentou Network
The Sentou Network allows students to sign up as potential opponents for other players. When a player fights mobs in the school area, there is a chance to encounter one of these student avatars instead. Inactive avatars are phased out regularly, keeping the pool fresh and unpredictable.
- Can be set in: Locker Room.
- Available areas: School Area.

### Fight Club
A secret and exclusive area where students can sign up as challengers and customize their skills and loadouts. Other students can then challenge them to a brawl to prove their own strength.
- Can be set in: Hideout.
- Available areas: Only in the Hideout.
